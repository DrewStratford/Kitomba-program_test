# Kitomba programming exercise

## Task

I chose to implement problem one (Trains).
The solution is written in Java and uses JUnit to test
the implementation against the tests detailed in the 
task document, as well as a few I have designed myself.

## Assumptions

My solution makes use of a lot Java 8 features such as lambdas, streams
and Optional. The graph should be an array of strings of the format:

	CharCharInt

This similar to what is laid out in the document, though I have assumed that the
station names must be exactly one char, rather than a string.

## Running

The code should be run through JUnit. There is a file "testing.java" that contains
the JUnit tests to be run. The easiest way to run it would probably be to import the project
into Eclipse or a similar Java IDE.
